## 📱 **Option 1: Test on Your Phone (EASIEST)**

### **What You Need:**
- Your iPhone or Android phone
- Expo Go app (free from App Store/Play Store)
- Same WiFi network as your Mac

### **Steps:**

#### **iPhone:**
1. Install **Expo Go** from App Store (if not installed)
2. Open **Camera app** on your iPhone
3. Look at your **terminal window** - you'll see a QR code
4. Point your camera at the QR code
5. Tap the notification that appears
6. **ELOURA opens!** 🎉

#### **Android:**
1. Install **Expo Go** from Play Store (if not installed)
2. Open **Expo Go app**
3. Tap **"Scan QR Code"**
4. Look at your **terminal window** - you'll see a QR code
5. Point your camera at the QR code
6. **ELOURA opens!** 🎉

## 💻 **Option 2: Test in Web Browser (QUICK PREVIEW)**

In the terminal where Expo is running, you can press:
- **`w`** = Opens in web browser (instant preview!)

This isn't perfect (it's meant for mobile), but you can see the UI immediately.

---

## 🖥️ **Option 3: iOS Simulator (Requires Xcode)**

**Note:** This requires Xcode to be fully installed (40GB+, takes hours)

If you have Xcode installed:
```bash
# In terminal, press:
i
# iOS Simulator opens
```

**Since you don't have Xcode fully installed, use Option 1 or 2 instead!**

---

## 🎯 **What's in Your Terminal Right Now:**

You should see something like:

```
