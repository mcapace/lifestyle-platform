  {
    question: "How does verification work?",
    answer: "We use a multi-layer system: ID verification, live photo check with liveness detection, and AI-powered behavioral analysis. This ensures every member is real and serious about the lifestyle."
  },
  {
    question: "How private is my information?",
    answer: "Extremely. We use military-grade end-to-end encryption on all messages. Ghost mode lets you browse anonymously. Face blur protects your identity. Your data never leaves our servers and is never sold. Ever."
  },
  {
    question: "What makes this different from other platforms?",
    answer: "We're built from the ground up for 2025. Native iOS and Android apps (not a wrapped website). Real verification (not optional). Curated community (quality over quantity). Modern design that doesn't look like it's from the 90s."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this just for couples?",
    answer: "No. We welcome couples, singles, and those exploring ethical non-monogamy. Whether you're curious about swinging, already active in the lifestyle, or exploring polyamoryâ€”this is your space."
  },
  {
    question: "When does it launch?",
    answer: "Q1 2025. Join the waitlist now to get founding member status, 50% off lifetime pricing, and priority access when we launch."
  },
  {
    question: "How do you prevent fake profiles?",
    answer: "Every profile requires ID verification and live photo check. Our AI flags suspicious behavior. Single guys pretending to be couples? Caught. Catfish? Blocked. Bots? Eliminated. Verification is mandatory, not optional."
